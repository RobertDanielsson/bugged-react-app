# Oh no, we got bugs

### Your objective is to solve the bugs in the application by applying Typescript and writing tests.

####  Use the existing types and create new ones if needed, doing this will help you find and solve the existing bugs.

#### The app has both .jsx and .tsx files, in order to use Typescript you need to rename the files to .tsx.

### Some of the issues include:

* There's an issue when submitting new students
* Calculation of students total age (**Important feature!**)
* Something spooky is happening with the registered users names
* Some tests aren't passing
* Probably more stuff, find it and fix it
