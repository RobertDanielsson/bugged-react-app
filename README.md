# Oh no, we got bugs 🪲🐞🪳

### Your objective is to solve the bugs in the application by applying Typescript and writing tests.

####  Use the existing types and create new ones if needed, doing this will help you find and solve the existing bugs.

#### The app has both .jsx and .tsx files, in order to use Typescript you need to rename the files to .tsx.

### Some of the issues include:

* Some parts use TS, some vanilla JS 🫨
* There's an issue when submitting new students 🧑🏽‍🎓
* There's an issue after submitting new teachers 👩🏼‍🏫
* Calculation of students total age (**Important feature!**) ➕
* Something spooky is happening with the registered users names ☠️
* Some tests aren't passing ❌
* Probably more stuff, find it and fix it 🐞

## Goals

* Implement Typescript
* Fix the bugs
* Add missing tests
* Implement additional features, for example removing students. Or whatever you find interesting 🦾
* Write down your findings. ✍🏼
  * What went well, what was difficult and which improvements did you implement?
  * Did TS improve the code?
  * Did TS help you find the bugs?
  * Any additional thoughts
* Bonus: Add some styling 👩🏼‍🎨

## To get started, start the app via the terminal by running "npm start".
### Pro tip: Run the tests to see what is failing. Either via your IDE or the terminal by running "*npm run test*".
#### *Super-pro tip*: Don't trust your tests *too much* 👀
